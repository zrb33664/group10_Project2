Database:
Crime Data from 2020 to Present - Catalog

Describe your dataset and what data it contains:
The data set includes data regarding the crime rate, locations and areas (as well as longitude and latitude), victims and their identifying information, the date and time of the crime, type of crime, status of the case (open, investigation ongoing, etc.), and further associated details like choice of weaponry. It was obtained from the LA Police Department from federal government records. The data types can be sorted and filtered because of some repetition in the types of crime, but for the most part, the time/date data is formatted as such and everything else is listed as if it were a dropdown. There are a total of 28 columns and 932,141 rows, with data detailed from 2020 and onwards.

The 2 questions the team generated and why they are interesting and important:
Question 1: What are the top 10 areas within Los Angeles with the highest crime rate from 2023 to now?
Question 1 is important because it can indirectly highlight the safety of certain areas, encouraging people to either avoid those areas or to invest more infrastructure in those areas and reduce the crime rate by tackling social issues like poverty, healthcare access, and economic policies. This is tied to the data set by using location/area as the main factor.

Question 2: Among those areas, what crime was committed the most and is there a pattern associated with when these crimes occurred?
Question 2 is important because it highlights the specific crime committed the most, which allows for residents to better prepare themselves and assess risk better, but also because the pattern associated with the crimes can be beneficial to highlight underlying social issues or take more direct policing action for safety and political reasons. This is tied to the data set by using location/area, but supplementing it with the variable type of crime as well.

The manipulations applied to the data set as part of the analysis:
The manipulations consisted of filtering by area and years, which had the purpose of narrowing down by timeline and safety of each area. We used both bar graphs and the map feature to sort by the most common type of crime as well as plot their occurrences on the map. The latitude and longitude measures used as rows and columns, respectively helped us create a map of the city where we could plot each individual crime. We sorted by the five most popular, which were Stolen Vehicle, Battery - Simple Assault, Theft of Identity, Burglary, and Vandalism - Felony in that order. 
(Plot a map with higher crime/crime prone areas, Find something related to those “10” areas, top or the bottom 10)


Analysis and Results: Analyse and visualise the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis.

The most common crime in the most common area was for stolen vehicles in the Southeast area with 113,418 reports. The Southeast also had either the highest or second highest crime rate for all of the crimes mentioned above except for burglary, where it wasn’t even in the top ten.
